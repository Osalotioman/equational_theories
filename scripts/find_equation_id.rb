This module maps magma equations from/to their id

It can be used as a script in interactive mode (with the -i switch), as

    ruby find_equation_id.rb -i

or by passing arguments to it from stdin or as arguments: a (space-separated)
list of ids or of equations (in which the operation can be ".", "*", or "â—‡"),
optionally preceeded by "*" to dualize the equation (and characters "[,]" are
ignored):

    ruby find_equation_id.rb [12, 34] "(w*u)=t*(u*x)" 4567 "*89" "*67" "0=(1*2)*(0*1)"

When used as a module imported in python code, one can use
- eq = Equation.from_id(integer id)
- eq = Equation.from_str(string)
- eq.id()
- all_eqs(integer order)
- eq.dual()
